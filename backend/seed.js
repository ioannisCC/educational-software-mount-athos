          <h2>🏛️ Ancient Beginnings</h2>
          <p>Mount Athos has been a center of Christian monasticism for over a millennium. Hermits were living on Athos by the 4th–9th centuries, but organized monastic life began in <strong>963 AD</strong> when Saint Athanasius the Athonite founded the first monastery, Great Lavra, with support from Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas.</p>
          
          <h3>📅 Key Historical Periods</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>4th-9th centuries:</strong> Hermits and early ascetics</li>
            <li><strong>963 AD:</strong> Foundation of Great Lavra by St. Athanasius</li>
            <li><strong>11th century:</strong> Multiple monasteries established</li>
            <li><strong>Byzantine era:</strong> Known as "Garden of the Virgin Mary"</li>
            <li><strong>1400 AD:</strong> Peak with 40 monasteries (20 survive today)</li>
            <li><strong>16th century:</strong> Last monastery (Stavronikita) founded</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>🏛️ Imperial Protection</h3>
          <p>Athos enjoyed imperial protection and a <em>Typikon</em> (charter) granted by Emperor John I Tzimiskes, which gave the community autonomy and set rules for governance. Despite challenges like pirate raids and later Ottoman rule, the monastic state survived through the Middle Ages, preserving its spiritual life.</p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>💡 Did You Know?</h4>
            <p>Mount Athos has remained continuously inhabited by monks for over 1000 years, making it one of the oldest monastic communities in the world!</p>

          <h2>⛪ The Holy Mountain</h2>
          <p>Mount Athos holds a pre-eminent place in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Known as the <strong>"Holy Mountain" (Άγιον Όρος)</strong>, it has been an Orthodox spiritual center since at least 1054 AD (after the Great Schism).</p>

          <h3>🚫 The Avaton Rule</h3>
          <p>The peninsula is dedicated entirely to prayer and monastic life, and by tradition <strong>no women are allowed to enter</strong> (a ban in place for over 1000 years). This rule, called "avaton," extends even to female animals, with exceptions only for cats (pest control) and certain birds.</p>

          <h3>🌍 International Orthodox Center</h3>
          <p>Athos is under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, yet it enjoys autonomous self-governance dating back to Byzantine times. The community's influence extends far beyond its borders:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Athonite monks spread traditions to Russia, the Balkans, and elsewhere</li>
            <li>Pan-Orthodox center with monasteries supported by various Orthodox countries</li>
            <li>Monasteries founded by Russian, Serbian, Bulgarian, and Georgian monks</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>🎨 Cultural Heritage</h3>
          <p>Many important relics, holy icons, and manuscripts are preserved in its monasteries, making it a living treasury of Orthodox Christian heritage. The Athonite school of iconography and Byzantine art has significantly influenced Orthodox art and spirituality worldwide.</p>

          <h2>🔒 Understanding the Avaton</h2>
          <p>The <em>avaton</em> (ἄβατον) is one of Mount Athos's most distinctive and debated traditions. This Byzantine law has been maintained for over a millennium, making it unique among religious sites worldwide.</p>

          <h3>📜 Historical Origins</h3>
          <p>The prohibition dates back to the <strong>Typikon of John Tzimiskes (972 AD)</strong>, which codified existing practices. According to tradition, the Virgin Mary herself blessed the peninsula and requested that no other women enter her "garden."</p>

          <h3>🐾 Scope of the Prohibition</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Humans:</strong> All women and girls, regardless of age or purpose</li>
            <li><strong>Animals:</strong> Female domestic animals (cattle, sheep, goats)</li>
            <li><strong>Exceptions:</strong> Cats for pest control, wild animals, birds, insects</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>⚖️ Legal Framework</h3>
          <p>The avaton is protected by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Greek constitutional law (Article 105)</li>
            <li>European Union recognition as a religious tradition</li>
            <li>International court decisions upholding the practice</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>💭 Modern Perspectives</h3>
          <p>While controversial in modern times, the avaton represents:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Preservation of ancient monastic practices</li>
            <li>Dedication to ascetic life and spiritual focus</li>
            <li>Respect for tradition in Orthodox Christianity</li>
